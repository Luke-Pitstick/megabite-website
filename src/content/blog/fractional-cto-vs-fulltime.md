As your restaurant grows, so do your technology needs. But does that mean you need a full-time CTO? For most local and small restaurant groups, the answer is no.

## The Full-Time CTO Reality

A full-time CTO for a restaurant typically costs:

- **Base Salary**: $150,000 - $250,000+ annually
- **Benefits**: Additional 25-35% of salary
- **Equity/Bonuses**: Often expected in competitive markets
- **Total Cost**: $200,000 - $350,000+ per year

That's a significant investment, especially when you consider that many restaurant technology needs don't require 40+ hours per week of CTO-level attention.

## Enter the Fractional CTO

A fractional CTO provides strategic technology leadership on a part-time or project basis. Think of it as having a CTO on retainer—you get the expertise when you need it, without the full-time cost.

### What You Get:

- **Strategic Planning**: Technology roadmap aligned with business goals
- **Vendor Management**: Negotiating with and managing technology providers
- **System Integration**: Ensuring your tech stack works together
- **Problem Solving**: Expert troubleshooting when issues arise
- **Team Support**: Training and supporting your staff on technology
- **Future-Proofing**: Keeping your systems modern and competitive

### What You Pay:

Typically **30-40% of a full-time CTO's cost**, depending on the level of engagement needed.

## When Each Makes Sense

### Choose a Fractional CTO if:

- You're a single location or small restaurant group (2-10 locations)
- Your technology needs are significant but don't require daily oversight
- You want expert guidance without the overhead of a full-time executive
- You need flexibility as your business and needs evolve
- You're looking to optimize and integrate existing systems

### Consider Full-Time if:

- You're a large restaurant group (15+ locations)
- You're building proprietary technology products
- You have complex, daily technology operations requiring constant oversight
- You have the budget and workload to justify a full-time role

## The Hybrid Approach

Many successful restaurant groups start with a fractional CTO and transition to full-time leadership as they scale. This approach:

- Minimizes risk and upfront investment
- Proves the value of dedicated technology leadership
- Allows you to clearly define the role before hiring full-time
- Builds the foundation and systems a future full-time CTO will manage

## Making the Decision

Ask yourself:

1. How many hours per week do we need CTO-level expertise?
2. What's our current technology budget and can we absorb a full-time salary?
3. Are we ready to commit to a permanent executive hire?
4. Do we have clearly defined technology goals and challenges?

## Real-World Example

A 4-location restaurant group was considering hiring a full-time CTO. Instead, they engaged a fractional CTO for 10 hours per week at $8,000/month ($96,000 annually).

In the first 6 months, they:
- Integrated their POS with online ordering and inventory
- Reduced monthly software costs by $1,800
- Implemented automated reporting that saved 15 hours/week of management time
- Created a 3-year technology roadmap

**Total savings**: They got executive-level expertise for less than half the cost while achieving their technology goals.

## The Bottom Line

For most local and small restaurant groups, a fractional CTO provides the perfect balance of expertise, value, and flexibility. You get strategic technology leadership without the overhead of a full-time executive—and you can always scale up as your needs grow.
